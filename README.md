According to Drupal 8 docs on events, we are suppose to do three(3) things:

## Registering event subscribers

I. Define a service in your module, tagged with 'event_subscriber' (see the Services topic for instructions). 

II. Define a class for your subscriber service that implements \Symfony\Component\EventDispatcher\EventSubscriberInterface.

III. In your class, the getSubscribedEvents method returns a list of the events this class is subscribed to, and which methods on the class should be called for 
each one. Example: 

So, lets do those 3 things now in our module(on_delete_event).
Indentation is two spaces (you may get drupal white screen error if not indented properly)
I.  services:
       on_delete_event.subscriber:
           class:  'Drupal\on_delete_event\EventSubscriber\OnDeleteEvent'
          tags:
             - { name: 'event_subscriber' }
